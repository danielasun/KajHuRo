Initialize Biped Robot
Define zmp system for x and y
Calculate preview Controller gains based on system
Create footstep planner

Repeatedly:
	
    Get initial conditions
    Simulate x and y zmp systems to get COM trajectory

	for each step:
		get next desired foot placement pair


		calculate swing foot trajectory

		for all time steps between the step:
			put out positions to all of the joints:
			update the COM's position
			IK swing leg
			IK stance leg 

		swap stance leg
		update positions

	Plan next 3 footsteps
	append additional steps
